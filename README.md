- [x] Population Mean
- [x] Median
- [x] Mode
- [x] Population Standard Deviation
- [x] Variance of population proportion
- [x] Z-Score
- [x] Population Correlation Coefficient
- [x] Confidence Interval
- [x] Population Variance
- [x] P Value
- [x] Proportion
- [x] Sample Mean
- [x] Sample Standard Deviation
- [x] Variance of sample proportion

This uses both built-in functions and CSV data sheets to test the 
functionality of the calculator.
